# Splunk Journey: Core User Certification Prep

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Splunk, the industry-leading Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. It serves as a central hub to track my progress, experiments, and exercises while preparing for the Splunk Certified Core User certification.

Inside this repository, you will find:

- Practice searches and queries – examples of SPL (Search Processing Language) queries and log analysis.

- Lab exercises – step-by-step walkthroughs of tasks performed in Splunk.

- Insights and observations – notes on challenges, tips, and key takeaways from working with the platform.

- Resources – links to official Splunk documentation, tutorials, and relevant study materials.

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured, hands-on approach to mastering Splunk Core User skills while maintaining a record of learning progress, so I can both reference past work and demonstrate practical experience with the platform.
