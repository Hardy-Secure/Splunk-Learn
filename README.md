# Splunk Journey: Core User Certification Prep

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Splunk, the industry-leading Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. It serves as a central hub to track my progress, experiments, and exercises while preparing for the Splunk Certified Core User certification.

Inside this repository, you will find:

- Practice searches and queries – examples of SPL (Search Processing Language) queries and log analysis.

- Lab exercises – step-by-step walkthroughs of tasks performed in Splunk.

- Insights and observations – notes on challenges, tips, and key takeaways from working with the platform.

- Resources – links to official Splunk documentation, tutorials, and relevant study materials.

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured, hands-on approach to mastering Splunk Core User skills while maintaining a record of learning progress, so I can both reference past work and demonstrate practical experience with the platform.

## Executive Summary
The Splunk Core User lab exercises provided a structured, hands-on environment for exploring and applying core Splunk functionalities. The primary goal of the lab was to develop practical experience in ingesting, searching, and visualizing data, as well as creating knowledge objects such as dashboards, reports, and alerts.

I gained familiarity with essential Splunk operations, including onboarding data from multiple sources, performing searches using the Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL), and generating actionable insights through visualizations. The exercises also reinforced best practices for organizing knowledge objects and managing user access within the Splunk platform.

For a more detailed, technical breakdown of the lab—including step-by-step procedures, screenshots, and analysis—please see the [Splunk Core Lab Documentation](https://github.com/Hardy-Secure/Splunk-Learn/blob/main/Lab-Breakdown.md).
